# Repository Analysis Report

## General Information
- **Repository Name:** carlosargelio/task-traker
- **Analysis Date:** February 22, 2025

### Detailed Evaluation

#### 1. Architectural Integrity
- **Score:** 7
- **Comment:** The project follows a layered architecture (presentation, application, domain, infrastructure) which promotes separation of concerns. The domain layer seems well-defined with entities and value objects. However, some cross-cutting concerns might not be fully addressed.

#### 2. Code Cleanliness
- **Score:** 8
- **Comment:** The code generally follows consistent naming conventions and is well-formatted. ESLint and Prettier are used, which helps in maintaining a clean codebase. Typescript is used, which aids in readability.

#### 3. Test Coverage
- **Score:** 6
- **Comment:** There are tests for value objects and some DAO implementations, but the coverage seems incomplete. Core use cases and other infrastructure components lack sufficient testing.

#### 4. Documentation
- **Score:** 5
- **Comment:** The README provides basic instructions on how to install and use the CLI tool, but there is a lack of detailed documentation.

#### 5. Scalability
- **Score:** 4
- **Comment:** The current implementation relies on a file-based data store, which might become a bottleneck as the number of tasks increases. The application layer and domain logic seems adaptable, but switching to a more scalable database would require significant changes in the infrastructure layer.

### Overall Assessment
- **Overall Score:** 6
- **Recommendations:**
  - Increase test coverage, especially for use cases and infrastructure components.
  - Add detailed documentation for the codebase.
  - Consider using more scalable persistence (i.e. PostgreSQL).
  - Evaluate the use of dependency injection for better modularity and testability.
